# Anonymous-Chat-Flux
Just a simple chat room app. It implements React's server-side rendering capabilities and attempts to integrate the 
Flux architecture. It also implements an extremely primitive search. 
You're gonna need to use npm to get all of the dependencies. Just run
 ```npm install``` in the root directory to do this. 

To actually start it up, run:

``` npm run start ```

It requires a mongod process. The db settings can be configured in ```config.js```.

It's setup to run on ```port:8080```. This can also be modified in ```config.js```.
